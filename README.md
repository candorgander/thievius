Welcome back! I've created a username generator called `thevieus!`. Picture the following scenario, you land on a web-application, start crawling through it only to find the faces of the company's employees plastered all over the site. Oh, and their first and last names are there as well. Hm. What do you do? Well, you could barbarically type out their names and transform them into common usernames for those names by hand. Or... you could use `thieveus!`

This tool uses the amazing work of [Dzmitry Savitski](https://github.com/dzmitry-savitski)'s John the Ripper username generation [rules](https://dzmitry-savitski.github.io/2020/04/generate-a-user-name-list-for-brute-force-from-first-and-last-name):
